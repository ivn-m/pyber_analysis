## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to describe the differences in ride-sharing data of weekly fares by city type (e.g. Urban, Suburban, Rural)

## Results

This analysis consisted of 2375 rides among three city types (e.g. Urban, Suburban, Rural). Among the three city types, there were 68,709 total drivers, whom collectively charged $63,538.64 in fares. The table above describes the total ride, driver, and fare count by city type. 

### Average fare per ride

Because urban city types have the highest amount of rides it accounts for the largest poriton of the cumulative fare amount, and the lowest average fare per ride. Similarly, because rural cities had the lowest amount of rides, it accounted for the lowest portion of the cumulative fare count. However, urban cities have a lower average fare per ride when compared to suburban and rural cities.

### Average fare per driver

There are a total of 537 drivers in rural cities. Rural cities have the lowest driver count when compared wo the other two city types. While rural city types have the lowest total cumulative fare, the average fare per driver is higher when compared to the other two city types. Drivers in urban cities, which have the highest total drivers count when compared to the other two city types have more competition to successfully take rides, and thus have more competition. Because of the high driver count, the average fare per driver is the lowest. 

### Total fare by city type

The line plot above describes the total fare by city type between January 1, 2019 and April 29, 2019. From the graph, we can see that urban cities had the highest total fare and rural cities the lowest total fare. The end of February had a sudden increase in fare (and likely ride counts) among all three city types. Urban and suburban city types had an increase in total fare between January 1, 2019 and April 29, 2019. While throughout the time frame the total fare increased and decreased in rural cities, the total fare seemed to end at the levels it started. 

## Summary
Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:
- Put a cap on the number of eligible drivers on urban cities so the average fare per driver increases. 
- Promote rides in rural cities so ride count increases, thus total fare increases.
- Put a cap on the number of eligible drivers on suburban cities so the average fare per driver increases.
