This analysis consisted of 2375 rides among three city types (e.g. Urban, Suburban, Rural). Among the three city types, there were 68,709 total drivers, whom collectively charged $63,538.64 in fares. The table above describes the total ride, driver, and fare count by city type.

Because urban city types have the highest amount of rides it accounts for the largest poriton of the cumulative fare amount, and the lowest average fare per ride. Similarly, because rural cities had the lowest amount of rides, it accounted for the lowest portion of the cumulative fare count.
