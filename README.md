This analysis consisted of 2375 rides among three city types (e.g. Urban, Suburban, Rural). Among the three city types, there were 68,709 total drivers, whom collectively charged $63,538.64 in fares. The table above describes the total ride, driver, and fare count by city type.

Because urban city types have the highest amount of rides it accounts for the largest poriton of the cumulative fare amount, and the lowest average fare per ride. Similarly, because rural cities had the lowest amount of rides, it accounted for the lowest portion of the cumulative fare count. However, urban cities have a lower average fare per ride when compared to suburban and rural cities.

There are a total of 537 drivers in rural cities. Rural cities have the lowest driver count when compared wo the other two city types. While rural city types have the lowest total cumulative fare, the average fare per driver is higher when compared to the other two city types. Drivers in urban cities, which have the highest total drivers count when compared to the other two city types have more competition to successfully take rides, and thus have more competition. Because of the high driver count, the average fare per driver is the lowest.
